# Loan Approval Model

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting loan approval status. The project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use. The model can be used to automate the decision-making process for loan approvals, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

## Contents

- `loan_approval_model.ipynb`: notebook containing the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `models/`: Directory where the trained model is saved.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- IDE
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-model.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd loan-approval-model
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data

The dataset used in this project is a fictional dataset representing various features that are typically used in loan approval processes. The dataset is included in the `data` directory and consists of the following columns:

- `Loan_ID`: Unique identifier for the loan application
- `Gender`: Gender of the applicant
- `Married`: Marital status of the applicant
- `Dependents`: Number of dependents of the applicant
- `Education`: Education level of the applicant
- `Self_Employed`: Whether the applicant is self-employed
- `ApplicantIncome`: Income of the applicant
- `CoapplicantIncome`: Income of the co-applicant (if any)
- `LoanAmount`: Requested loan amount
- `Loan_Amount_Term`: Term of the loan in months
- `Credit_History`: Credit history of the applicant (1: Good, 0: Bad)
- `Property_Area`: Area where the property is located (Urban/Semiurban/Rural)
- `Loan_Status`: Whether the loan was approved (Y) or not (N)

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize data distributions
   - Identify correlations between features

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features
   - Normalize numerical features

4. **Model Building and Training**:
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Train various machine learning models
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compare performance of different models
   - Select the best model based on evaluation metrics

6. **Model Saving**:
   - Save the trained model for future use

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Open your notebook:
    ```bash
    notebook loan_approval_model.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the entire workflow.
